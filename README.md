# Grid Game \<needs improvement>

~~A small arcade shooter style game made in Unity~~

A hypercasual game that resembles Whack-a-Mole and a challenging Manoeuvre mode.

## Idea Log

* Circular Breakout game
* Top-down shooter
* Run and Gun with RNG
* Leashed Dodge and Shoot
* Dodge only (Subway Surfers but 4 directions)
* Audiosurf minus Music
* Grid whack-a-mole (sci-fi)
